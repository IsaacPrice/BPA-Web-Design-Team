Basically anything that has to do with a Date doesn't work properly

The Merch page isn't filled out properly
The Tour page isn'y filled out properly, make sure to cut down images to 3:2 ratio

Both Merch and Tour pages need to have the paypal checkout, along with a prompt that says if they sucessfully purchased whatever

Have to get the band member cards where it will fade between image when you hover on them.

Most of the About and Home page are subject to (a lot) of change.

The Contact Us page needs to have a response when the user submits a booking request.

Most of the images need to be double checked and verified that they are labeled corerctly
    source image is source, cut down source is about half that at around 1080p, and small is around 480p

The footer is yet to be made, it probably just going to have our names, bpa numbers

Update the photos of us, in the bandMember data to be the transparent background ones

Change the about us carousel to be automatic when hovering over it.

Crop the StageFright images so that there is no excess transparent stuff

Update the github repository to include the better documentation, and instructions to build and use on their own

the home page has a button 'listen now', but it doesn't do anything. Figure out if we make a page with more links,
    leave as is, or make some sort of indication that it should redirect them

Change the title and icon

Replace anything with a href to a onclick => navigate
